This is the base component - the program takes the users budget
and recommends which items are the best value for money, based on
the weight and price of the item. The program returns the best
recommended item within the users budget

base v1 - skeleton of program, setting up functions
base v2 - setting up functions: not blank component and item name component
base v3 - setting up functions: num checker, budget and item price
base v4 - major changes to make code more flexible as explained on slide 33 of testing powerpoint
